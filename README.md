## Introduction_the goal
This code aims to estimate the value of pi using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The basic idea is to generate a large number of random points within a square with sides of length 2 and centered at the origin. The fraction of points that fall within the unit circle inscribed within the square will approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square, which is pi/4. By multiplying the fraction of points within the circle by 4, we can obtain an estimate of pi.

## Introduction_the deatail
The code uses multithreading to speed up the generation of random points. The generate_points function generates num_points random points and checks how many fall inside the circle. The circle_points and total_points variables keep track of the number of points inside the circle and the total number of points generated, respectively. The lock object is used to ensure that multiple threads don't try to update these variables at the same time and cause race conditions.

After all the threads have finished generating points, the estimated value of pi is computed as 4 times the ratio of circle_points to total_points.

The ZeroDivisionError occurs when the total number of generated points is zero, which happens if the generate_points function is called with num_points equal to zero. To avoid this error, you could add a check at the beginning of the generate_points function to return immediately if num_points is zero.

## Usage
Execute the program by running the following command in the terminal:
'''Python
python Q417.py
'''

## Output
The output of the program is the value of the estimated value of pi (pi_estimate). Since this is generated by a random simulation, the value obtained may be different each time the program is run, but it should be close to the true value.
